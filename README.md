## <Challenge-03>

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to create a password generator that could be used to obtain a truly random and secure password.
I built this project so that when I need a password I can use a generator to create a secure one.
It solves the problem of having to use the same unsafe password for every website, if paired with a text document you could create a list of all created passwords
Throughout this project I learned a lot about Javascript. Random number functions, list item iteration, and how frequently you use variables to just name a fraction of them.
